## Digital Coalition Air Force Official Livery Pack

 ## 1. Download/Install: https://github.com/sedenion/OpenModMan/releases/download/0.9.4/OpenModMan_0-9-4-x64_setup.exe
 ## 2. Download Livery Updater tool: https://github.com/DCAFOC/Livery-Updater/releases/tag/1.0.0
 ## 3. Before running the Livery Updater tool, follow these steps to setup Open Mod Manager (Recommend running as admin if you're having issues with the below):
 
After installing OpenModManager, run it and go File > New > Context
(This is where the Context profile will save, this doesn't have to be anywhere specific).

### After, click Next > This is where you'll select the destination folder 

### (Where you installed DCS)

Also create a custom libery folder (Where we'll tell the Livery Updater tool to install/update the Livery repo).

I used my old OVGME Mods folder for simplicity, make sure you've uninstalled any old versions of the liveries (Run repair DCS in windows start if you didn't use a mod manager).

### Click Finish

Finally once you've completed the download from running the Livery Updater tool, you'll see the folder appear in Open Mod Manager, just install it.
